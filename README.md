# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic data.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, which includes features such as:
- Glucose
- BMI
- BloodPressure
- Age
- Insulin
- Pregnancies
- SkinThickness

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Model
- Logistic Regression
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🎯 Accuracy
Achieved around **X%** accuracy (fill this based on your model result)

## 📎 Output
Confusion matrix and classification report included.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model
